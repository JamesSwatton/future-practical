	<p>We were approached to create a set of exhibition furniture for the current
Design for Our Times exhibition at the V&amp;A Dundee, where we had the
opportunity to investigate exhibition design practise and in particular towards
temporary displays and their associated impacts.</p>
<p>Temporary exhibitions require bespoke display elements specific to the
exhibition design and the form and dimensions of exhibits being displayed.
These structures are often single use due to this specificity and often end up
being chucked i a skip at the end of the show, where they are either sent to
landfill or are incinerated. Commonly used materials are manufactured board
such as MDF, which we know emits toxic chemicals into their surrounding
environment.</p>
<p>◆ <em>How might we make exhibition practise more responsible and sustainable?</em></p>
<p>◇ Our approach was to really focus on the use of the furniture to keep it in the
loop of use and to change it from being single use to something that could
either be reused in future exhibitions or repurposed as something else. Also we
are really keen on open-sourcing the design so that it may act as a prototype
that can be iterated upon and developed by others who may benefit from this
concept.</p>
<p>◇ We wanted the design to act as a concept or fiction from a post-waste future,
where waste isn't an option and to create a visual narrative of how that might
look and function and in doing so designing out waste.</p>
<p>◇ We deconstructed the idea of the plinth made from MDF and thought about it cut
into sections, as strips of material that could be joined together again along
their edges using the universal fixing and assembled by a single person.</p>
<p>◇ This led to a modular system consisting of panels of a fixed width with various
lengths, determined by simple multiples, allowing the sizes of the plinths to
be scaled using any combinations of the panels. The panels could then be
reconfigured into different size plinths in future use cases or repurposed as
utility furniture, for example a <a href="">bookshelf</a>.</p>
<p>◇ The important thing for us was that the design was intuitive and simple to
assemble and disassemble, therefore removing any future barriers in the reuse
of the panels.</p>
<p>◇ The panels needed to consist of a singular material that could be easily
recycled at the end of its use and not made of materials that can't easily be
separated. It was also important that the plinths functioned as well as or
better than their single-use counterparts and could easily support heavy loads,
whilst remaining manoeuvrable.</p>
<p>◇ We arrived at aluminium as a potential material for its high strength and
durability and because it recycles within our current municipal system and it
can be recycled time and time again without loss of material properties.</p>
<p>◇ The design of the panels had in mind ease of manufacturing using local industry
as well as being something that could be manufactured globally by downloading
the production files, rather than by sending the physical parts. This meant not
using a digital manufacturing process that is highly distributed. The parts can
be either laser cut or water jet cut to high precision with relatively low
costs, and in this case they were laser cut locally to us in Glasgow.</p>
